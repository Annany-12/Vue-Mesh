# Vue-Mesh, a 3D Model Viewer Web App
A React-based web application that allows developers to upload and visualize 3D models (GLTF/GLB) directly in the browser. This tool is designed to help developers quickly preview their 3D assets on the go.

### Features
- Real-time 3D Model Viewing: Upload GLTF/GLB files and view them in the browser.
- Interactive 3D Models: Rotate, zoom, and inspect models in real-time.
- Smooth Animations: Implemented using GSAP for animations.
- Lightweight Design: Built with React and vanilla CSS for a fast, responsive UI.

### Tech Stack
- **React:** Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
- **Vanilla CSS:**: Custom styles without using any CSS frameworks.
- **Three.js:** JavaScript library for 3D rendering.
- **GSAP:** Used for smooth animations.

### Features

### Installation and Setup
###### Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/Annany-12/vue-mesh.git`

- Navigate into the project directory
`cd vue-mesh`

- Install the dependencies
`npm install`

- Running the App
`npm run dev`

### Future Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Improve the robustness of the application by implementing better error handling for file uploads and rendering issues.
- **More Files:** Adding Support for more file formats.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize 3D rendering for larger models.
- **Additional Features**: Add support for additional file formats, real-time editing, and animations.

#### Note: 
Some basic models for your testing purposes are provided in a folder named `some_test_models`. You can use these models to quickly test the app's functionality.
